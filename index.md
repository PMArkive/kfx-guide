# petzku's KFX resource

Despite originally naming this a "guide", it's more a sort of a random mishmash of various knowledge and understanding about KFX I've developed over time. Calling it a guide is kind of misleading, though I suppose some of the things I've written (or will write) here could be considered as such.

Even the more down-to-business "guides" are generally going to be more like pointers about the general ideas at play, rather than straight-up walkthroughs. I _heavily_ recommend experimenting with a lot of the examples I give, as well as trying your hand at recreating the effect _before_ reading the guide portion.

Being an eternity project, new pages will probably pop up every now and then. Not all pages will be listed here immediately, mostly if they're still in progress of being _actually written_.
